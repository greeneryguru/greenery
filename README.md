# POTNANNY
_"Plant care when you're not there"_

Potnanny turns a Raspberry Pi into a powerful greenhouse monitor/controller. Keep all your potted plants healthy and happy.

Potnanny interfaces with inexpensive off-the-shelf components, allowing you to set up a fully automated growing system for a fraction of what commercial systems cost:
 - Xiaomi Mi Flora bluetooth soil sensors.
 - Xiaomi Mi BT bluetooth temperature/humidity sensors.
 - Vesync Wifi power outlets.
 - Wireless RF power outlets*.
 - _more devices coming soon_

## RESPONSIVE APP ##
The Potnanny web app is compatible most browsers, and looks great on any sized screen.

## DASHBOARD AND GRAPHING
Check the status of your room environments from the Dashboard view.
Drill down for detailed measurements and graphs, to gain insight into the history of your room environments.

## TAKE CONTROL
Set up _Actions_ to maintain an optimal environment.
Not only will this make your plants happy, but it can save you money. For example, turning on devices like exhaust fans and dehumidifiers only when needed, rather than running them all the time, can reduce energy costs.

**Example actions**
_Maintain humidity between 45% and 50%_
- "If humidity is greater than 50%, turn on power outlet called 'dehumidifier'. Turn 'dehumidifier' off when humidity is less than 45%"

_Maintain temperature between 24 and 28 degrees celsius_
- "If temperature is greater than 28, turn on power outlet called 'exhaust fan'. Turn 'exhaust fan' off when temperature is less than 24"

_Keep soil moisture consistent between 18% and 22%_
- "If soil-moisture is less than 18%, turn on power outlet called 'irrigation'. Turn 'irrigation' off when soil-moisture is greater than 22%"

## GROW CYCLES
Start a new grow cycle in your room. Keep track of how many days the room has been in *growth* or *flowering* phase.
At the end of the grow, download detailed history for your records.
Compare previous grows to see if certain environmental changes made plants healthier and more productive, or not.

## PLUGIN SYSTEM
Easily add custom Actions or BLE Sensor scanners.

## COMPATIBILITY
The following Pi devices with WiFi and Bluetooth LE have been tested to work:
 - Raspberry Pi 3 (recommended)
 - Raspberry Pi Zero W
