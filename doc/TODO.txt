    - Move all page javascript functions to separate .js file
    - Create python class/module to wrap rf "send" command and make it more
        modular.
    - Django ModelForm is not correctly updating the Schedule "days" field
        when the field is defined as a HiddenInput in forms.py, so currently
        I have it built as a regular visible NumberInput, but this is a hack.
        Must find a better way to deal with that form.
    - Build scheduler cron/daemon to deal with Schedules.
